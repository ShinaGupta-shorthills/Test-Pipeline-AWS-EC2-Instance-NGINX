ðŸš€ How It Works (Layman Explanation)
You push this code or run the GitHub Action manually.

GitHub uses your AWS credentials to call EC2.

A new virtual machine (EC2) is created.

As it boots, it runs a script (nginx-install.sh) that installs and starts NGINX.

You now have a live server with NGINX running.
